true analog doesn't exist in RaPi thus, we use PWM
communication - asynchronous serial and I2C
breakout boards
relay - activated by an electrical signal - kind of like a mosfet
relay - switch and an electromagnet
led pins and detection of current require really less current. Use high resistane to prevent burning.
